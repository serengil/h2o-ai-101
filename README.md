# h2o-ai-101

This repository includes h2o.ai based implementations and documentations.

1- **h2o frame** [`Tutorial`](https://sefiks.com/2019/09/13/h2o-frame-calling-forth-the-power-of-ten-tigers/)

Pandas is de facto standard for data manipulation operations among data scientist. It is fast but it runs on single cpu core. Herein, h2o frame is a powerful alternative to pandas. It supports multi-core calculations whereas it covers almost same functions with Pandas.

2- **h2o GBM** [`Code`](https://sefiks.com/2019/09/18/a-gentle-introduction-to-h2o-gbm/), [`Tutorial`](https://github.com/serengil/h2o-ai-101/blob/master/python/H2O-GBM.ipynb)

GBM dominates tabular data based kaggle competitions nowadays. Herein, h2o covers both XGBoost and its own GBM. This is a gentle introduction to h2o GBM.

3- **h2o AutoML** [`Code`](https://github.com/serengil/h2o-ai-101/blob/master/python/H2O-AutoML.ipynb), [`Tutorial`](https://sefiks.com/2019/09/03/a-gentle-introduction-to-h2o-automl/)

The hottest topic in machine learning is AutoML. Even though model design is accepted as state-of-the-art, today AutoML can design better models than us. h2o AutoML covers linear models, tree-based models including random forest and gradient boosting (XGBoost and h2o GBM) and deep learning (regular fully connected neural networks).
